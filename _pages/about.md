Welcome to my personal webpage where you can learn about my research and myself! My name is Mia Charifson (she/her/hers) and I am a graduate student at Arizona State University pursuing an MA in Global Health in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change. 

Research Interests
======

My research focuses on informing medical understanding and treatment of various female health disorders. Pulling from my training as an evolutionary biologist, I hope to improve the clinical research into and public health approches to several female health disorders including polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, female autoimmunity, female infertility and menstrual disorders.

Please note that I use the term female to refer to individuals who at any point in their life has or has had a uterus, vulva and/or vagina. Because sex, like gender, is not binary and everyone is the expert of their own experience, there may be female individuals who do not associate with the disorders/symptoms/experiences, I study and describe. If you are experiencing any of the disorders mentioned on this site, I encourage you to seek out a resource that you trust and know that you deserve to feel the best that you possibly can in your body.
